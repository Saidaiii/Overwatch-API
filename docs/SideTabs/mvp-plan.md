## Version 1 (current)
**The current version can:**
* Provide player data (in a disorganized manner)
* Provide basic hero data

## Version 2 (next)
**The next version will:**
* Require tokens to connect
* Have admin routes to change the data
* Have written `Mocha` tests for all the new admin routes
* Will have Hero images `JPEG`

## Version 3 (in the works)
**This are some real hard work to get:**
* More routes for other data
  * Voice Lines `Text` and `MP4`
  * Sprays

## Final Version (Future Stretch Challenge)
**This is going to be difficult:**
* Have the API be able to scrape Hero data from the Overwatch official site
* Have the data stored in the Database
* Have premium routes to always provide the scraped data from the database
  * Only for signed up / paying users
